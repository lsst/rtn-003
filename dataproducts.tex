\section{Types of Data Products for IDACs}\label{sec:data}
% Operations-era language for data products, as defined in  LSE-231, should be used

The three categories of \RO data products, {\it Prompt}, {\it \gls{Data Release}}, and {\it User Generated} are defined in the \RO \gls{Data Product} Categories document  \citeds{LPM-231}.
Both the {\it Prompt}, {\it \gls{Data Release}} data products are produced by \RO and include images, both raw and processed, and catalogs of both {\tt Object}s and {\tt \gls{Source}}s.
The  {\it User Generated} data products are produced the community using the resources of the \RO \gls{Science Platform} \citeds{LSE-319}.
These data products are described in detail in the Data Products Definitions \gls{Document} \citeds{LSE-163}.

Below, three potential realizations of the the \RO {\it \gls{Data Release}} data products that IDACs might consider hosting are described: the full {\it \gls{Data Release}} including images, the {\it \gls{Data Release}} catalogs only, and a low-volume (``{\tt lite}'') subset of the {\it \gls{Data Release}} catalogs.

\subsection{Full \gls{Data Release}(s)}

In this case the \gls{IDAC} would be hosting all of the raw and processed images, and catalogs, as described in \citedsp{LSE-163}. Hosting the raw image data at an \gls{IDAC} requires roughly $6$ petabytes per year of storage, so this represents a significant augmentation of resources in terms of both hardware and personnel. The processed data and associated calibrations bring the total data volume to $0.5$ exabytes for a single data release. Some data volume could be saved by taking only a single calibrated image per band, but the total would still be $60$ petabytes (with compression it may be possible to reduce this even further). Any \gls{IDAC} considering hosting the full {\it Data Release} should also deploy the full \RO \gls{Science Platform} \citeds{LSE-319} in order to maximize science productivity and their return on investment in hosting an \gls{IDAC}.

\subsection{Catalog Server}

Alternatively, an \gls{IDAC} may find that hosting only the {\it Data Release} catalogs, and not the images, is sufficient for the scientific needs of its community. This will probably require the specific \RO database server \citedsp{LDM-135} and specific machines, and the deployment of the database system and the associated subset of data access services (\gls{DAX}; e.g., web APIs, \gls{Qserv}, \citeds{LDM-152}). The full {\tt Object} catalog, which contains one row per object with a volume of $\approx 20$ kilobytes per row, is estimated to contain about $40 \times 10^9$ objects (even in the first full-sky data release). Adding to this the full {\tt Source} and {\tt Forced Source} catalogs, which contain one row per measurement in each of the $\sim80$ visit images obtained per year, brings the total storage volume required up into the petabytes range, and will require a serious commitment of resources at the proposed \gls{IDAC}. The evolution of data sizes over the 10-year \gls{LSST} is depicted in \figref{fig:catvol}, the catalog size for the final release is order $15$ petabytes. For more details on the row counts see the Key Numbers Page\footnote{\url{https://www.lsst.org/scientists/keynumbers}}.

\subsection{An ``{\tt \gls{Object} Lite}" Catalog}\label{sec:lite}

Many -- perhaps most -- astronomers' science goals will be adequately served by a low-volume subset of the {\tt \gls{Object}} catalog's columns that do not include, for example, the full posteriors for the bulge+disk likelihood parameters.
This {\tt \gls{Object} Lite} catalog would nominally contain $1840$ bytes per row for the $40 \times 10^{9}$ objects, giving a size of $\approx 7.4 \times 10^{13}$ bytes ($\sim74$ terabytes).
Even smaller, science-specific versions of {\tt \gls{Object} Lite} could be envisioned with even less columns and/or separate star and galaxy catalogs.
The Solar System community for example will be primarily be interested in the contents of  just the  {\tt SSObjects} table.

These would not be small enough to handle on a laptop, but might be served by a small departmental cluster.
Searching even a small {\tt \gls{Object} Lite} catalog would require some form of database, but many institutes would already have a system which may be capable of loading this data.
In this case, \RO might only ship files with documentation and not provide administrative support for the system, but this would allow the {\tt \gls{Object} Lite} catalog to be widely available to all partner institution IDACs. Distribution options such as peer-to-peer networking to avoid download bandwidth limitations might be possible to implement in this case.
